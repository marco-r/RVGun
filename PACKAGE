  <p> RVGun is a module that connects to Shotgun Studio assisting the user to 
  upload a version properly. RVGun guides the user through projects, assets,
  shots and tasks assigned to him/her, allowing the user to add tags and a
  description to the version to upload.

  Thanks to rvio, a quicktime movie is generated from the open sequence in rv
  and a slate containing all the data related to the version is created.
  Finally RVGun creates a thumbnail from the current frame in rv and performs
  the upload to Shotgun.
